In integration GST SR, this scenario coded properly. However, in ERP an entry is passed in a way that the revenue GL gets nullified. Since goods are moving from one state to another but within the same PAN, they first book revenue account and then reverse revenue account, both within the same entry instead of passing separate Sale and Purchase entry.
